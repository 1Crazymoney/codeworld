Privacy Policy
==============

The CodeWorld web server at https://code.world is offered and
maintained by Chris Smith, as a service to others. This server is
provided by Chris Smith at no cost and is intended for use as is.

The CodeWorld web server executes open source software available at
https://github.com/google/codeworld.  However, the CodeWorld server
is separate from the software, and you may also use the software on
a different server.  This privacy policy applies only to the
CodeWorld server at https://code.world, and not to any other server,
even if it is executing the same software.

If you choose to use the CodeWorld server, then you agree to the
collection and use of information as provided by this policy. The
personal information that I collect is used for providing and improving
the Service. I will not use or share your information with anyone except
as described in this privacy policy.

Information Collection and Use
------------------------------

During normal operation, the CodeWorld server will provide you with tokens,
in the form of URLs, which you can choose to share with others.  These
tokens will provide access to the code which you have submitted to the
server, to help you share your creations with others.  By submitting your
code, you agree that the CodeWorld server may provide your code to anyone
who has obtained these tokens.

When using the CodeWorld server, you may optionally sign in and save your
data.  This is not required to use the CodeWorld server, but doing so will
enable additional features, including saving and loading projects.  When you
sign in, the CodeWorld server collects information which can be used to
associate you to projects which you have previously saved.  When you use
the feature to save projects, the CodeWorld server will retain your
projects along with this identifying information, for the purpose of
providing it to you in the future.

As part of the normal operation of this server, data is collected in logs.
These logs may contain the number and timing of requests, IP addresses, and
request information such as URLs and headers.  This information will not be
shared except as provided in this policy.

Cookies
-------

Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are commonly used as
anonymous unique identifiers. These are sent to your browser from the
websites that you visit and are stored on your device's internal memory.

The CodeWorld server does not use these cookies explicitly. However, it
does use third party code and libraries that use cookies to remember
information about you.  You have the option to either accept or refuse these
cookies and know when a cookie is being sent to your device. If you choose
to refuse our cookies, some features of the server may not work as intended.

Service Providers
-----------------

I may employ third-party companies and individuals for the following reasons:

* To facilitate the service;
* To provide the service on my behalf;
* To perform related services; or
* To assist in analyzing how the service is used.

If you use the CodeWorld server, these third parties may have access to your
personal information. The reason is to perform the tasks assigned to them on
our behalf. However, they are obligated not to disclose or use the information
for any other purpose.

Security
--------

I value your trust in providing your information, and I strive to use
commercially acceptable means of protecting it.  But remember that no method of
transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure and
reliable, and I cannot guarantee its absolute security.

Links to Other Sites
--------------------

This Service may contain links to other sites. If you click on a third-party
link, you will be directed to that site. Note that these external sites are not
operated by me. Therefore, I strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy
of these websites. I have no control over and assume no responsibility for the
content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.

Changes to This Privacy Policy
------------------------------

I may update this privacy policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to
review this page periodically for any changes. I will notify you of any changes
by posting the new privacy policy on this page. These changes are effective
immediately after they are posted on this page.
